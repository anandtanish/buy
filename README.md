Simple Product Landing Page & Thank You Page
This project consists of two basic web pages: a product landing page displaying two products and a thank you page for a successful purchase. Both pages are built using plain HTML and styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern, and responsive design.

Files Included
landing-page.html: This is the main landing page. It showcases two distinct products with images, descriptions, prices, and "Buy Now" buttons. Each "Buy Now" button is linked to the thank-you-page.html (or a placeholder for a product detail page).

thank-you-page.html: This page is displayed after a user hypothetically completes a purchase. It provides a confirmation message and a link to return to the landing page.

How to Use
To view these pages:

Save the files: Save the content provided for landing-page.html and thank-you-page.html into two separate files with these exact names in the same directory on your computer.

Open in Browser: Simply open landing-page.html in your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

Navigate: Click the "Buy Now" buttons on the landing page to navigate to the thank you page. Click "Continue Shopping" on the thank you page to return to the landing page.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure and content of the web pages.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling, ensuring responsiveness and a modern look without writing custom CSS. The Tailwind CDN is included directly in the HTML files.

Future Enhancements
Actual Product Detail Pages: Replace the placeholder links on the landing page with actual product detail pages (product-detail.html?product=...) that provide more information about each item.

Dynamic Content: Implement JavaScript to load product data dynamically, rather than hardcoding it in the HTML.

Shopping Cart Functionality: Add a functional shopping cart to manage multiple product selections.

Form Submission: Integrate a backend system for actual purchase processing and order management.

More Products: Easily extend the landing-page.html to include more product cards.

Navigation Bar: Add a simple navigation bar for better site navigation.
